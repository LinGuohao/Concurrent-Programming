What is synchronized block used for?
Java allows multi-threaded concurrent control. 
When multiple threads operate a shared resource variable at the same time (such as data addition, deletion, modification, and check), 
the data will be inaccurate and conflicts between each other. 
Therefore, synchronization locks are added to avoid this Before the thread completes the operation, it is called by other threads, 
thus ensuring the uniqueness and accuracy of the variable.
