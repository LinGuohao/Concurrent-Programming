How can we create nad start a thread?
	Method 1: Inherit the Thread class
		 Start the thread by calling the start method

		  Pass the Runnbale object as a parameter to the constructor of Thread to create Thread.
	                  And call start method of this thread
	Method 3: Create and start a new thread using the Callable interface
		  Rewrite call() in the callable class, use callable to create FutureTask objects, 
		  then use FutureTask to create Thread, and finally start Thread
